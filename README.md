# EDA260 PVG - Enduro Team 0x8
A project in the course [EDA260](http://cs.lth.se/eda260/) Software Development in Teams at Lund University 2011. The aim with this course was to give knowledge about and practical experience on cooperation within a software development team.  Focus is on the method Extreme Programming, which uses a highly iterative work process.  The course covered principles for customer cooperation, planning, sustainable design and implementation, testing, and delivery of the product. The course also gave additional training in object-oriented programming. 

More specifically each team had a on-site customer who wanted a time tracking system for the motorcycle race Enduro. In the end all the teams simulated a race and the software was tested in field.

This is a dump form the last SVN revision and not a complete migration since the original server is down.

Our team was prodly awarded for good code quality and usage of Object Oriented patterns.

A Gource visualization of the SVN repo is available at [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/20217811).
